We need to make case_model_auto_tuned.py resumable
also save the prediction and respectie time stamp

# loss function selection
now i am testing the loss function
MSE, MSLE, MAE, MQPE
it turns out MSLE is the best

# now I test if clipping the ancient data away will improve the prediction error

# try to have more search

# try to have some random search first and then guided search
# doing 50 guided search
100%|██████████| 50/50 [12:27<00:00, 14.95s/trial, best loss: 3.142857142857143]

# doing 25 random and 25 guided search

# should first test the hyperparemter combination that is used in the last sliding window

# interval 30 is better than tuning 5 and 1
Check plots to see why

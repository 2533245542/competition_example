do transfer learning
in a sliding window
    before training on 663, first train a model on the rest sites. using lambda 1 save the weights
    load weights before training on 663, using lambda 2

when tuning
    an lambda evaluation includes
        train a model on the rest of the dataset, this conducts one lambda search and produces lamdba 1, save the weights

in a sliding window
    load weights
    make layers other than the dense layer non-trainable
    train a model on the 663 dataset, and predict

do more tuning in the first time, less afterwards, or set a limit until converge

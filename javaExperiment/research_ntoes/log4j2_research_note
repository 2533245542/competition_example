We have tested the usability of log4j2.
It is usable.
To use, we need to add a logger and appender pair for a technique

for example, we have made a logger for technique32. Whatever passed to the logger is printed to file "log/reportOfTechnique32.csv".

It uses an appender called "technique32Report" which outputs log to file "log/reportOfTechnique32.csv", and a logger called "technique32"
